yoyo is a local password manager that helps you store, create new passwords for online services.

to use;
`yoyo add github.com johngitahi`
if 5th arg received it treats that as the password, else it will create a password and show it to you then you can copy that and use it on that website.

to retrieve the password if you cannot remeber

`yoyo ret github.com johngitahi`

look at ways that i can use to store the password securely locally

commands i am thinking of creating:
yoyo status, delete, change-master, export, genx
